# Memory Game Project

The Memory Game Project is a game that allows you to test your memory by finding matching card pairs in a deck of 16 cards. You need to find all 8 matching pairs to win.

### Game play

When the game starts, you will see 16 cards face down on the game board. Click on a card to turn it over and view its symbol.

After clicking on 2 different cards (that are face down), the game will compare the symbols on each card. If there is a match, the cards will turn green and remain face up. If there is no match, the cards will turn face down again.

Continue clicking on the cards until all the cards remain face up (i.e. after you have found all 8 matching pairs). At this point, you will have won the game.

### Tracked metrics

Note that while you play, the game will track the number of moves you make. A move occurs after you have clicked on 2 different cards that are face down at the time.

The game will also track the total time elapsed until you win in minutes and seconds.

Finally, the game will provide a star rating out of 3. The more moves you take to win, the lower your star rating. 

### Winning the game

Upon winning the game, the game board will disappear, and instead, you will see a message that includes the total time elapsed, the number of moves taken, and your star rating.

### Other game aspects

The game also provides an option to restart. You can restart mid-game, and you can also restart after winning. Every time you restart the game, the cards on the game board will be shuffled.
